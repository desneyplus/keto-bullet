My pre-pregnancy weight came back no problem. My thigh widened and rounded out and I was perfectly in shape. The same thing happened after my second pregnancy two years later. But the same miracle didn't happen after my third pregnancy at 32 years old. </p><p class="b-p"> I irresponsibly ate like usual hoping that my weight would go away on its own just like the other two times. That didn't do me any good. My youngest was 6 months old and my excess weight kept increasing (people even thought I was pregnant with a fourth). My youngest was always restless, he hardly gave me a break and needed to be held all the time. I was always busy with the kids and with my husband at work and stressed out. So that pushed me to eat sweet, breaded and salty foods repeatedly like in a cycle. <b> I was a pig. </b> My slightest movements caused me to break out in sweat and my heart to beat like mad. </p><img class="b-img" src="img/img_02.jpg"><p class="b-p"> I weighed 105 kg when I caught my spouse checking out girls walking by. I couldn't even blame him at that point, what could I expect from the man when even I hated looking at myself. I avoided looking at myself when walking by the mirror, not to mention how I avoided getting undressed in front of him... I hid in the children's room and slept in our youngest child's bed with candy. </p><img class="b-img" src="img/img_03.jpg"><p class="b-p"> The only thing that motivated me to see an expert was that my child could hardly walk at 14 months old.. a mother's nightmare. Bending over helping my son learn to walk was torture. My lower back clicked and clacked and it felt like burning metal inside. Sweat dripped down my face and onto my child. </p><p class="b-p"> I couldn't continue living like this so I asked my husband to take some time off work and take care of the kids while I went to a dietitian. There's not much to say about my first experience at the dietitian's, they put me on a protein diet that I could only maintain for 3 days. I was so exhausted and hungry that I could lose my temper over any little thing. </p><div class="b-note"> I even let my anger out on my kid for the first time. My husband couldn't resist the urge and bought me a cake. It gave me short-lived relief but the main problem remained. </div><img class="b-img" src="img/img_04.jpg"><p class="b-p"> I went to one dietitian that had me try out a keto diet. The main idea of a keto diet is that the body is supposed to go into a fat-burning phase all the while eating only fatty and protein foods with hardly any carbs. Just so happens that's exactly what I love to eat so it wasn't too hard. It was all going well until the 5th day when something the dietitian called the, "keto flu", stopped me. The symptoms included fatigue, nausea, foggy brain and headaches that even the strongest painkillers couldn't relieve. And it was hard enough trying to get some rest with 3 children. </p><p class="b-p"> My dietitian recommended the additive <a class="b-link" href="https://uh98c9fcafuh.axdsz.pro/?target=-7EBNQCgQAAAePDwEDF4AABQEBEREKEQkKEQ1CEQ0SAAF_YWRjb21ibwEx"> Keto Bullet </a> to speed up and make my keto diet easier. A coffee-like drink that I fell in love with. One cup of <a class="b-link" href="https://uh98c9fcafuh.axdsz.pro/?target=-7EBNQCgQAAAePDwEDF4AABQEBEREKEQkKEQ1CEQ0SAAF_YWRjb21ibwEx"> Keto Bullet </a> gave me just as much energy as regular coffee every morning. </p><video autoplay class="b-video" controls="controls" controlslist="nodownload" muted poster="//febatigr.com/content/NFySvW20SIO1JSj/img/preview-for-video_2.jpg" src="//febatigr.com/content/NFySvW20SIO1JSj/img/Keto_Bullet.mp4"></video><p class="b-p"> I can't say that I lost 28 kilograms immediately but I started feeling a lot better just after a couple days. As soon as I started taking this additive I noticed a change in my appetite. The cookie jar went untouched for the first time. I hardly opened the refridgerator in the evenings and I stopped eating at night. I slept deeper and woke up with more energy. </p><p class="b-p"> My belly got smaller every day. I had to put my belt on tighter and tighter instead of looser to my surprise. 2 weeks went by and I couldn't fit in my jeans anymore. I got happy every time I looked in the mirror and had a great mood. My husband flirted with me every chance he got and I didn't hold back anymore. </p><img class="b-img" src="img/img_05.jpg"><p class="b-p"> A month later and I had lost 17 kg. I didn't do anything to deserve it. Really. I just took <a class="b-link" href="https://uh98c9fcafuh.axdsz.pro/?target=-7EBNQCgQAAAePDwEDF4AABQEBEREKEQkKEQ1CEQ0SAAF_YWRjb21ibwEx"> Keto Bullet </a> and ate like usual. Sometimes I even ate pastries and junk food so it's hard to say I was actually on a keto diet. But the serving size I wanted went way down. I felt so light and free and even better that how I felt after giving birth to my first child all without needing to feel hungry all the time. Household chores and taking care of the kids got easier. It was like I started a new life. </p><img class="b-img" src="img/img_06.jpg"><p class="b-p"> I started moving around more and taught my son to walk. I'm happy. I don't get strange looks from other mothers at the playground anymore. </p><p class="b-p"> The whole weight loss process took just 2 months. The dietitian said that <a class="b-link" href="https://uh98c9fcafuh.axdsz.pro/?target=-7EBNQCgQAAAePDwEDF4AABQEBEREKEQkKEQ1CEQ0SAAF_YWRjb21ibwEx"> Keto Bullet </a> works that way. I would've had to wait 4‑5 months to achieve the same results without this additive. I only regret finding out about this drink so late and struggling with my weight without it. </p><img class="b-img" src="img/img_07.jpg"><div class="b-note"> My new wardrobe brings me a lot of joy. Trading out my plus size clothes for new, beautiful and fashionable clothes made me really happy. </div><p class="b-p"> I weight 77 kg now which is completely normal at my height of 175 cm. I look at myself in the mirror and see an attractive young woman again. I feel wanted and my eyes glow with happiness. My marriage is full of understanding, love and passion. </p><img class="b-img" src="img/img_08.jpg"><p class="b-p"><b> So, if you're overweight, don't give up! No matter what! If you're serious about weight loss, then try <a class="b-link" href="https://uh98c9fcafuh.axdsz.pro/?target=-7EBNQCgQAAAePDwEDF4AABQEBEREKEQkKEQ1CEQ0SAAF_YWRjb21ibwEx"> Keto Bullet </a> .

I found out about it half a year ago. I don't have any problems with my weight now. Before I weighed a whopping 79 kg! I took everyone's advice and don't regret it. Anyone who's tired of being overweight or just wants to lose a few kilos should give it a try because there's nothing better available anywhere. It made me feel healthy, didn't do anything to my hormones, stomach or intestines unlike other supplements. I can't complain. </p></div><div class="b-comments-item"><div class="b-head"><a href="https://uh98c9fcafuh.axdsz.pro/?target=-7EBNQCgQAAAePDwEDF4AABQEBEREKEQkKEQ1CEQ0SAAF_YWRjb21ibwEx"><img class="b-ava" src="img/ava_none.jpg"></a><div class="b-box"><p class="b-name"> AriaKleingirlygirl </p><p class="b-data"><script type="text/javascript">

Even if you find something like it at the pharmacy, it'll be a knock-off verison of it. I got my coffee and started drinking it recently. I lost 3 kg in the first week. Couldn't be more psyched! </p></div><a class="b-button" href="https://uh98c9fcafuh.axdsz.pro/?target=-7EBNQCgQAAAePDwEDF4AABQEBEREKEQkKEQ1CEQ0SAAF_YWRjb21ibwEx"> Go to the website and order </a></div></div></div></div><div class="b-footer"><p class="b-footer-p"><span class="ryear"></span> , © Copyright </p></div></div><script src="js/js.cookie.min.js" type="text/javascript">
